NOTES FOR DREW:
Sinatra installed and working for lab 01 - but now rspec wont work? not sure what is going on there

Module 1: Datatypes & Variables

- run test suite: `rspec spec/01_data_types_and_variables.rb`
- up Sinatra `ruby labs/01_data_types_and_variables/hello_world.rb`
- should be no errors and have a quick mad lib sentence


TROUBLESHOOT:
- rspec/sinatra not working: MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING RUBY 2.4.0,
    - uninstall/reinstall gems
