# Adopt a Pet

In this application, we'll be running an animal shelter, pairing pets with their perfect forever homes!

### Tests

After taking a look at the spec file and the `adopt_a_pet.rb`, run the tests and start troubleshooting.

`rspec spec/02_methods_spec.rb`

### Running the lab

Once all of your tests pass, you're ready to open for business!

run either:

`rake run_lab:2`

or

`ruby labs/02_methods/runner.rb`

### Bonus

- How can you change the name of the shelter? You'll need to look in the runner file.
- Can you write your own method the will return the shelter name?
- What if you wanted to change the name? What if you wanted to input the name when the file first runs?
