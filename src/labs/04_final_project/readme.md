# Choose your own Adventure

Get into two teams, you're going to have to work together to build a text adventure game from scratch. You'll then break it, switch, and fix the other team's application.

## Instructions

In this lab, you will be building a text adventure game from scratch. There are no tests and only minimal scaffolding for your application. Decide on the story you want to tell, and take a look at what has been set up in the project folder.

_Narrative_  - these method return the text of your application.

_User_ - retrieves user input and stores user details

_GameEnginer_ - this is the logic machine for your game

_runner.rb_ - where the story comes to life

### Teams
- Split into two teams
- Each team should rotate driver and navigators
  - Not everyone needs to be on the same screen the whole time. Researchers can break off to google a question or try something out while the rest of the team continues building out the application.

### Turns
- Start by whiteboarding or adding to a previous whiteboarding exercise
- You'll have about 15-20 minutes to build functionality onto your application
- Once time is up, you'll have 7 minutes to discretely break your application
- Switch to the other teams code base.
  - Take a look at their whiteboarding, fix their application, add functionality, break, switch and repeat

### Special Rules

_Celebrity Driver_ - If you know what you want to do, but don't know how to do it - you have two chances to invoke a celebrity driver. An instructor will take over the keyboard and implement your commands as best they can for up to 5 minutes. Be clear and precise in your instructions.
